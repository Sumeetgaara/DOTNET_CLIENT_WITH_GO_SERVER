# DOTNET_CLIENT_WITH_GO_SERVER
This post is not about how to learn GO or details of GO, It is just my experience with GO in general.

Last to last weekend I developed REST API in asp.net core 2.0 and I loved it.I wrote a post explaining new concepts,performance and features which asp.net core brings to the table of developement.As I was exploring more this week about asp.net core, I kept getting these articles about http performance of asp.net core vs elixir(Phoenix) vs GO and how they stack up against each other.Next thing I started learning(still learning) GO and developing REST API in GO.<br>
<br>
<br>
Following thing I noticed while I was working with GO.<br>
-Writing GO programs are like writing C programs, both follow imperative paradigm of programming.<br>
-GO is developed to scale and give high performace.<br>
-Struct and pointers are quite famous in GO( Dude! no class and oops? Nope.I told you it follow imperative paradigm)<br> 
-Entire GO code is directly compiled into binaries(SEE! c and go are definitely siblings.lol)<br>
-GO is so explicit.You just declare a variable in GO,don't use it and your code will never compile.<br>
-Goroutines and channels are really awesome concepts.<br>
-Use of channel to interact with different goroutines is pure joy.<br>
-Dotnet world gives you that developer's productivity whereas I struggled with GO for 2 days to just connect GO code with mysql database.<br>
-Go also has Web frameworks like Buffalo,IRIS etc.<br>
-There are alot of concepts in GO which will be out of scope of this post(like concurrency,channel synchronization,defer etc) but I think you got the gist<br>
<br>

TBH,I don't want to compare GO with my favourite .NET world because I understand each envirnoment will have its pros and cons.You need to understand your use case and pick one.Learning new concepts and new programming paradigm gives you different perpesctive/angle on same problem.So I would encourage you to pick new tool, build something out of it and use that experience in solving new problems.
Happy Coding :)
